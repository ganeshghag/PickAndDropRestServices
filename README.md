# PickAndDropRestServices

This project contains maven based spring-data JPA REST services code for PickAndDropApp which I made for mastek innovation contest.
The UI portion is built as a mobile app using appery.io SAAS

Intent here was to demo functioning REST services actually being used on a live app.

The domain modle is hardly complex. The project remains a tech demo
